# Drum Event Detection
Ongoing Project to automatically transcribe drum beats using deep neural nets.

You can use "Audio Synthesis.ipynb" to generate your own drum beat audio given a midi file and folder of drum samples. It writes the generated audio to Output_Audio. Use feature_generator.ipynb to generate audio features of all the files in Output_Audio. Then you can use these features to train the model using Model.ipynb. Currently the model is not learning correctly, my guess is there's a bug.  

Unfortunately I can't upload the drum samples until I know I'm not breaking a copyright law, but you can use your own wav files for this.
